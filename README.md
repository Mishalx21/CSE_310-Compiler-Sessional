# CSE_310-Compiler-Sessional
This repository includes my implementations of the assignments from the Compiler Sessional course at the Department of CSE, BUET. Throughout the course, we work on building a simplified C compiler from scratchâ€”covering everything from lexical and syntax analysis to semantic checks and intermediate code generation.
